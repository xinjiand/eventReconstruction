Overview:
  This is the overview

Directories:
  crossSections: This directory contains two subdirectories that store gamma ray cross sections for elemental and
                 composite materials. Also in this directory is the XCOM code from NIST
                 (http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/xcom/) which can be used to generate cross sections for materials that
                 are not listed in the databases. 
  
  data:          Houses the quenching data used in the code.
  
  include:       This directory contains the headers for the classes and functions needed for the simulation. The
                 documentation for each class/header is fairly complete, so see these for more information.
  
  inputs:        Contains the input for the code. The input file, quench.in, has comments relating to its use and
                  format.
                  
  lib:           Contains the object files for the classes/headers

  old:           Contains old code that is not relevant for the use of the simulation.

  outputs:       Contains the outputs of the quenching code. 
  
  src:           This directory contains the definitions for the classes and functions needed for the simulation. The
                 documentation for each class/header is fairly complete, so see these for more information.

Programs:
  quench: This code simulates the neutrino capture tag and A2 background events for LENS. The code does the appropirate 
          gamma tracking and outputs the location of the scatters with quenching applied.
