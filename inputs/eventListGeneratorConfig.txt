# This file contains the configuration flags for the fake data generator.
# The flags give the following behavior:
# genFlag:        Picks the random number generator to use. 
# seedFlag:       Seeds the random number generator with a known seed (seedFlag=0 -> seed=1013) or a
#                 UNIX time seed (seedFlag==1).
# nCells:         The number of cells along a side of the detector. You will also have to change the
#                 value in the file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# latticeFlag:    This flag sets the type of lattice the detector uses: 1 -> air-gap, 2 -> 
#                 perfluooctane, and 3 -> Teflon FEP. You will also have to change the value in the
#                 file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# mirrorFlag:     This flag turns on (mirrorFlag==1) of off (mirrorFlag==0) mirrors for the lattice
#                 light transport code. You will also have to change the value in the file
#                 include/detectorParameters.hh.
# guideFlag:      This flag turns on light guides (for guideFlag==1, 2, or 3 the lattice light
#                 transport code gangs 1, 2, or 3 lattice channels together respectively) or off
#                 (guideFlag==0). You will also have to change the value in the file
#                 include/detectorParameters.hh.
# reactorPower:   The power in MW of the reactor that the detector is deployed at  
# baseline:       The distance in meters between the reactor core and the detector
# backgroundRate: The rate that background gammas deposit energy in the detector in kHz
