#This file contains the configuration flags for the reconstruction program.
#The flags give the following behavior:
# reconType:    This number gives the type of reconstruction to use: 0->charge only (ie. a
#               replication of Bruce's tt-v2 code); 1->waveform for both the primary and side
#               channel PMTs (This reconstruction takes a step in E then a step in t.); 2-> charge
#               first and then the waveform reconstruction, with the energies fixed, to set the cell
#               timing.
# nCells:       The number of cells along a side of the detector. You will also have to change the
#               value in the file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# latticeFlag   This flag sets the type of lattice the detector uses: 1 -> air-gap, 2 -> 
#               perfluooctane, and 3 -> Teflon FEP. You will also have to change the value in the
#               file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# mirrorFlag:   This flag turns on (mirrorFlag==1) of off (mirrorFlag==0) mirrors for the lattice
#               light transport code. You will also have to change the value in the file
#               include/detectorParameters.hh.
# guideFlag:    This flag turns on light guides (for guideFlag==1, 2, or 3 the lattice light
#               transport code gangs 1, 2, or 3 lattice channels together respectively) or off
#               (guideFlag==0). You will also have to change the value in the file
#               include/detectorParameters.hh.
#
#               WARNING: The reconstruction may not have the required parameters for certain
#               options.
