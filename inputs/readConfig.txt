#This file contains the configuration flags for the readGeantData and IBD_Generator program.
#The flags give the following behavior:
# genFlag:        Picks the random number generator to use. 
# seedFlag:       Seeds the random number generator with a known seed (seedFlag=0 -> seed=1013) or a
#                 UNIX time seed (seedFlag==1).
# nCells:         The number of cells along a side of the detector. You will also have to change the
#                 value in the file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# latticeFlag     This flag sets the type of lattice the detector uses: 1 -> air-gap, 2 -> 
#                 perfluooctane, and 3 -> Teflon FEP. You will also have to change the value in the
#                 file include/detectorParameters.hh.
# mirrorFlag:     This flag turns on (mirrorFlag==1) of off (mirrorFlag==0) mirrors for the lattice
#                 light transport code. You will also have to change the value in the file
#                 include/detectorParameters.hh.
# guideFlag:      This flag turns on light guides (for guideFlag==1, 2, or 3 the lattice light
#                 transport code gangs 1, 2, or 3 lattice channels together respectively) or off
#                 (guideFlag==0). You will also have to change the value in the file
#                 include/detectorParameters.hh.
# pmtCoupleFlag:  To couple (1) or not couple (0) the PMT to the light guide
# distribFlag:    This flag determines where in the detector to places events. Flags -1, 0, and 2
#                 are intended to be used with the data that was generated prior to 03/01/2015; 
#                 these data were generated by running events in a semi-infinite geometry. See the 
#                 file inputs/dataFileInfo.txt for more infomation. Setting the value of distribFlag
#                 to 3 is intended to be used with the data generated afterwards. 
#                   distribFlag   Description
#                   -1            This value is used for testing. Events will start all events at 
#                                 the exact center of the detector and the initial momentum of the
#                                 particle going in the same direction as the Geant4 simulation.
#                   0             This value generates all events at the center of the detector with 
#                                 an isotropic distribution.
#                   1             This value generates events uniform in  the detector with an
#                                 isotropic distribution.
#                   2             This value starts events from either of the z sides uniformly
#                                 distributed on those sides. This option is intended to simulate 
#                                 the incidence of external gamma rays onto the detector. Note that 
#                                 the IBD_Generator will not accept distribFlag==2.
#                   3             This flag simply uses the deposits given by Geant4.
#
# fiducailVolume: This flag is set to the number of outer layers that you want to exclude. For
#                 example, setting this to 1 in a 15x15x15 lattice with a distribution flag of 1 will
#                 have events generated uniform in the inner 13x13x13.
#
# quenchFlag:     This flag sets the method by which quenching is applied to the energy deposits. 
#                 Setting the flag to 0 gives the legacy behavior where the quenching is applied 'by
#                 hand' to the heavy charged particles. Setting to 1 means that all the deposits are
#                 assumed to already be in MeVee.
#
# scinTimeRes:    This flag sets the time response for the scintillator:
#                   scinTimeRes   Description
#                   0             Uses a simple exponential with a decay constant of 2.2 ns which is
#                                 the decay constant for EJ-254.
#                   1             Uses the gamma, fast neutron, or thermal neutron time response 
#                                 from "Comparative analysis of pulse shape discrimination methods 
#                                 in a 6Li loaded plastic scintillator" NIM, 788A, 146 (2015)
#                                 depending on the particle ID that is depositing energy.
#
#                 WARNING: The reconstruction may not have the required parameters for certain
#                 options.
